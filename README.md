supermarket and pricing 
A burger restaurant selling burgers wants a system to quickly calculate the total price of an order: 
-	A burger costs â‚¬3 euro 
-	If 3 or up to 10 burgers are bought then for every 3 burgers you get a free burger. 
-	If over 11 burgers are bought a 50% discount is given. 
 
==> Create a console project to calculate the total price.
